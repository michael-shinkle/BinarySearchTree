### Team Member Roles
The project owner was able to effectively communicate between the client and the users, and pass that information on to the Scrum Team in a clear manner that gave the rest of the Scrum Team a clear direction to go with in the project. This was shown during the initial client meeting, the focus group with the users, and when the changes from the client came down. The developer was able to process the information from the project owner and implement it into the code. The tester was able to create meaningful tests that helped reduce the number of errors in the developer's code. The tester was able to look at the user stories created and develop tests that would ensure the developer was able to create working and efficient code. Both the tester and developer were able to react to changes on the fly, with very little delay. This was shown when the changes from the client came down asking for the top five travel destinations to be changed to detox/wellness vacation destinations. As the Scrum Master, my job was to help answer questions the rest of the team might have, facilitate development of the product, and to give the junior members of the team agency and a sense of ownership off the product. 

### Scrum-Agile Approach to SDLC
Utilizing the agile approach to the software development life cycle allowed the team to quickly react to the user stories and implement them in the final design.  Because of this, ideas that weren’t thought of in the initial product planning such as filtering search results or customizing results based on previous travel, were able to be implemented and included in the product quickly and efficiently. The waterfall method would not have allowed the team to react to the user stories during development as the ideas would have had to been thought of during initial product planning, and if a change came down that was required to be in the program, production would have had to stop and go back to the top of the waterfall. 

### Scrum-Agile Approach to Change in Product Requirements
Although the change was content related instead of functionality related, it was very easy to make the updates to the code. Agile was very useful to this because instead of having to have meetings about the new changes, the developer and tester were able to immediately implement changes to the code to meet the client’s new vision for the product. When the product owner gave the new requirement of switching from top five vacation destinations to the top five detox/wellness vacation destinations, the tester was able to jump right on board with the new changes, and although the developer was a little bit slower, she was still able to quickly and effectively update the code to the new requirements. 

### Interteam Communication
Effective communication is a vital part of Scrum Team success. The first example of effective communication within the team is an email from the tester to the product owner: 


>Dear product owner, 
>
>    I have read through the user stories and I am creating test cases to check the functionality of the product to determine whether that element passes or fails. I need some clarification on a few of the user stories so that I can clearly define my test cases. Can you answer these questions for me?
>
>User Story #1: 
>
>After the price filter is applied, do you want the results filtered from highest price to lowest price, vice versa, A-Z, or do you want them returned with the highest rating on top? 
>
>Do we want the user to be able to select their ordering method? 
>
>User Story #2: 
>
>Have we landed on the final format of the page? Will it be rows of destinations or will it be a slide show? 
>
>User Story #3: 
>
>Do you want the user to apply the filters using a check box system or a drop-down menu? 
>
>Once the filter is applied do you want the highest rated destination to be on top? 
>
>Thank you, 
>
>Tester 


This correspondence is effective because the tester broke the questions down into specific user stories giving the product owner context for the question. The tester also asked questions that require a specific answer rather than a vague one, allowing the questions to be answered in one email exchange, increasing efficiency. 

The next example of effective communication is between the developer and the product owner: 

>Dear Product Owner, 
>
>I have read through the new requirements for the travel site and I have a couple requests so that I can move forward more efficiently. 
>
>Is it possible to get the actual top 5 detox/wellness destinations from the client? I will also need photos and copy for the slide show. I can put placeholders in for now to get a look and feel, but having the final images and text from the client will let us move forward on the final design that much quicker. 
>
>Thank you, 
>
>Developer 

This email is effective because it asks for specific information that will help the development of the product. This gives the product owner a clear direction to move towards in getting information from the client., 

### Tools and Principles for Success
The daily Scrum is one of the most important tools to any Scrum Team. This even gives every member of the team an opportunity to update the group on what they’ve accomplished, and what they are currently working on. This also gives the team the opportunity to answer any questions a team member might have, and to make sure that everyone is being efficient in their work. A great tool that the team used is Azure Boards. This provided a digitized version of Kanban Boards along with some additional functionality that allowed the team to remain in sync regardless of if they were in the office or not. An additional advantage is that the Daily Scrum and Azure Boards are synergistic in that the Azure Board can display the progress that each Scrum Team member is talking about to give the rest of the team context. 

### Was Agile the Best Approach for This Project?
One of the best parts of agile is its ability to react quickly to changes in requirements. During the development of the SNHU Travel project the Scrum Team was able to quickly adjust to new needs based on user stories, or new requests from the client. A con of agile is that although updates are rolled out quickly, the initial product isn’t necessarily the final version, and will require constant updates to satisfy users and the client. I think that the agile approach is the best approach for the SNHU Travel project. The waterfall method would have required the client and executives to figure out what the requirements for the entire project need to be ahead of time, slowly develop all of those features, do testing, and then roll out a final version of the product. The agile method allowed the SNHU Travel Scrum Team to start in a general direction and react to changes to the requirements quickly and efficiently. The agile approach is superior in this case because it gives SNHU Travel a functional product quickly, and then continues to build upon it to deliver the best user experience possible. 

### Interpreting User Needs
Having user stories is an essential part of interpreting user needs and implementing them into the program. Without user stories, it would be up to the Scrum team to figure out what the user wants, and that's going to end up just being what the Scrum team wants. Gathering user stories gives you specifics to what the users of the progam want to see implemented. Once the Scrum team has the user stories, they are able to assign a development priority list based on importance of that feature to the overall program and ease of implementation.

### My Approach to Software Development
I use an iterative approach to software development. I will work to base functionality as quickly as possible, then I will go back and refactor code to make sure it is clean and scaleable. Welcoming a change in requirements is an important principle of Agile, so I make sure that my code is able to accept changes quickly and easily.

### Being a Good Team Member
A good team member works hard, is reliable, and puts the team's goals before their own. A good team member helps others on the team when they can, takes responsibility for their work, works well with others, and steps up to challenges.
